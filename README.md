jQuery plugin to stop customers from changing sensitive software settings

###How many times have you got this call...

**Customer:** Yeah... I wasn't thinking and I changed some important settings. My software isn't working now.

**You:** Why did you do that?

**Customer:** I don't know.

**You:** Didn't we ask you NOT to touch those settings?

**Customer:** Yes.

###Here's a solution

With one line of jQuery and one line of PHP... you can protect sensitive areas in your web applications.

noTouchi assures you that sensitive changes will only be made with the help of a technical support person.
